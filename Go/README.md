# Golang

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go. _(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming*language)))*

One of the great benefits of Go is the fact that it has been designed with the modern web and CPUs in mind, allowing the creation of web apps with only the vanilla libraries.
